    What i learn in the zoom call is:

        0. How to gether info when new project is assgined you. ?
        A. go throgh that entire psd 
            -> calculate font size,font-family,container,wrapper,
            -> try to compare your code in psd with pixel by pixel  
                if you're matching your code please take ss then take low opecity from 1 to 9 and match it.
            -> if you stuck in any problem dont hasitate to search on google 


        1. Talk about basic info of vijay
        2. How i manage look of website fonts all stuff
        A. Try to custmize the fonts and use the actual fonts
            so now how will you use the actual fonts which described in PSD.
                -> download that fonts from google font
                -> goto https://www.web-font-generator.com/ link
                -> merge that to the fonts folder
                -> in .css file.

        3. Take ss of what you made then try to combine your .html to .psd 
        A. -> if it matching then you have to follow pixel to pixel.
           -> try to make proper use of padding and margin
                => know excetly where you want to use margin & Padding.
                => e.x. set of section in that we give padding top but its wrong
                    section1 => give margin bottom & try not to give padding top
                    section2 => give margin bottom & try not to give padding top
                    section3 => give margin bottom & try not to give padding top 
                    section4 => give margin bottom & try not to give padding top
                    section5 => margin top

                    Margin will use between sections as of now.
                    Padding will use in sections as of now.

                    try to write in one line 
                    
                            top-bottom / left-right: 
                    margin: 0px          opx;
                    padding:0px          opx;
                    
                            top/right/bottom/left
                    margin: 0px 0px   0px    opx;
                    padding:0px 0px   0px    opx;

            -> try to write actual class instead of wrong classes like col-sm-12 col-lg-12 and read about those concepts
            -> try to write well formet code in HTML and CSS with excellent naming convention as sagar bhai told you.
               also apart from that try to make much simpler so any one can make changes in this.

                ex. if you wrote any section just refer the name and wrote as main-mouse,main-mobile-section like this
            
        4. what and how i can hover image

             then set the attributs to make hover over that img
